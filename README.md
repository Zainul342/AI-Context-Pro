    The ultimate standardization layer for AI-assisted dev. I built this so my agents would stop being stupid.

## 📦 What's inside this repo??

- **[Agent Init](./agent-init)** -- The VS Code extension itself. This is the main thing.
- **[Docs](./docs)** -- Technical stuff if your into that. 

## 🌪 Why does this exist?
Tired of manually setting up `.cursorrules` and `.agent` for EVERY project. If you're building stuff with AI in 2026, you know the drill -- copy, paste, fix, repeat. its honestly such a waste of time. 

**AI Context Pro** fixes that pattern. It dumps the necessary standards into your project so you can focuses on shipping code. 

## 📚 Technical Specs/Docs
Check these out if you want to see the "why" behind the "how":

* **[Product Requirements (PRD)](docs/PRD.md)**
* **[System Architecture](docs/System_Architecture.md)**
* **[Technical Specifications](docs/Technical_Specifications.md)**
* **[Risk & Scalability](docs/Risk_Security_Scalability.md)**

## 🧠 Philosophy (kinda)
Standardisation is important but annoying. AI "context rot" is real -- when the bot forgets your I/O rules halfway through a refactor. This provides the ground truth starting point!!

Built this named after my cat who keeps jumping on my keyboard while I type. Probably works on Windows tho I haven't tested it much there lol.

## 📄 License
MIT. Do whatever.
