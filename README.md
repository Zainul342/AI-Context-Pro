## 📦 Projects in this Repo

- **[Agent Init](./agent-init)**: The VS Code extension that bootstraps your project standards.

## 🌪 The Mess
Tbh, I got tired of manually setting up `.cursorrules` and `.agent` directories every time I started a new project. If you're like me, you probably have a "god-folder" of markdown files you copy-paste into every repo just so your AI agent (Cursor, Windsurf, whatever) doesn't start hallucinating about your architecture.

**AI Context Pro** (via Agent Init) fixes this. One command, and your workspace is standardized. No more "Wait, did I include the security mandate in this project?"

## 📚 Technical Documentation

If you're a contributor or just curious about the internals, check out these docs:

- **[Product Requirements (PRD)](docs/PRD.md)**
- **[System Architecture](docs/System_Architecture.md)**
- **[Technical Specifications](docs/Technical_Specifications.md)**
- **[Risk & Scalability](docs/Risk_Security_Scalability.md)**

## 🧠 Why I built this
Standardisation (or standardization? idk, I use both) is key. Dealing with AI "context rot" where the model forgets your I/O isolation rules after 50 messages is a nightmare. This ensures the prompt always starts with a solid foundation. 

I built this named after my cat who likes to walk on my keyboard whenever I try to write markdown. 

## 📄 License
MIT. Do whatever you want with it.

Made with ❤️ by [Zainul Mutaqin](https://github.com/Zainul342) - tbh mostly built this for my own workflows but hope it helps.
